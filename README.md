# blenv

*This project is in its beginning stages and is currently non-functional.*

A simple project bundler that squishes all of your project dependencies into a single file for execution!

## About

The idea for the project came from the desire to have a very simple-to-use Docker alternative for times when I want to have a single executable, but the project relies on something external, like files to write to or read from. 

It also just sounds like a really fun and potentially very useful project.
