*This project is in its beginning stages and is currently non-functional.*

A simple project bundler that squishes all of your  project dependencies into a single file!

## About

The idea for the project came from the desire to have a very simple to use docker alternative for times when I want to have a single executable binary, but the project relies on something external, like files to write to or read from. 

It also just sounds like a really fun and potentially very useful project.
